# 🤖 Hand Gesture Recognition

A real-time hand gesture recognition system using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and optionally **MediaPipe**, capable of detecting and classifying hand gestures via webcam input.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project captures live video from the webcam, detects hands using computer vision techniques, and classifies common gestures like ✋, 👌, ✊, etc. It's built for use in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), gesture-controlled systems, and smart automation.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 Real-time video feed using OpenCV
- ✋ Hand detection and tracking
- 🧠 Gesture classification using custom logic or ML model
- 🔧 Easy to extend for custom gestures or actions
